        MediSITE is a website that caters the medical supplies that customer needs through online ordering. In this time of a pandemic, people choose to order online and buy stuff through the internet rather than go out and buy it on a physical store. The site is ran and used by trained and graduate pharmacist to ensure that anyone who buys the medicine will get the exact one it needs. However, due to certain limitations, the website doesn’t sell medicine that needs a doctor’s prescription.
